> The integer **_linear-programming problem_** is like the 0-1 integer-programming problem given in Exercise 34.5-2, except that the values of the vector $x$ may be any integers rather than just $0$ or $1$. Assuming that the 0-1 integer-programming problem is $\text{NP-hard}$, show that the integer linear-programming problem is $\text{NP-complete}$.

We know 0-1 integer programming is NP-complete. To prove integer linear programming is NP-hard, we reduce from the 0-1 integer programming problem.

Given a 0-1 integer program:

$$
A x \le b, \quad x_i \in \\{0,1\\},
$$

convert it into an integer linear program without predefined bounds on the variables:

1. Add constraints to ensure $x_i \le 1$:
   Append the $n \times n$ identity matrix $I$ and the vector $\mathbf{1}$ to get:
   
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
A \\\ I
\end{pmatrix}x 
\le
\begin{pmatrix}
b \\\ \mathbf{1}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

3. Add constraints to ensure $x_i \ge 0$:
   Append $-I$ and $\mathbf{0}$:
   
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
A \\\ I \\\ -I
\end{pmatrix}x 
\le 
\begin{pmatrix}
b \\\ \mathbf{1} \\\ \mathbf{0}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Now, each $x_i$ must be an integer satisfying $0 \le x_i \le 1$. Thus, any integral solution to this system corresponds exactly to a solution of the original 0-1 problem. Since 0-1 integer programming is NP-complete, integer linear programming is NP-hard.
