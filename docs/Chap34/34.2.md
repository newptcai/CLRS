> Prove that if $G$ is an undirected bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices, then $G$ is nonhamiltonian.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a bipartite graph with bipartition $V = X \cup Y$, where $X \cap Y = \emptyset$. Assume for contradiction that:

1. The total number of vertices $n = |X| + |Y|$ is **odd**.
2. $G$ contains a **Hamiltonian cycle** $C$.

Since $G$ is bipartite, the cycle $C$ must alternate between vertices in $X$ and $Y$. Starting at a vertex in $X$, the cycle proceeds to $Y$, then back to $X$, and so on. To return to the starting vertex in $X$, the cycle must consist of an **even** number of steps. However, $n$ is odd, making it impossible to alternate perfectly and return to the starting point.

This contradiction implies that $G$ cannot have a Hamiltonian cycle when $n$ is odd.
