> Show that if $\text{HAM-CYCLE} \in P$, then the problem of listing the vertices of a hamiltonian cycle, in order, is polynomial-time solvable.

We can use the following Lemma:

**Lemma:** Let $G$ be a Hamiltonian graph. If every edge in $G$ is **essential**, meaning it must appear in **every** Hamiltonian cycle of $G$, then $G$ itself must be a Hamiltonian cycle.

**Proof of Lemma (by Contradiction):** Let $C$ be a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$. Assume $G \neq C$, meaning there exists at least one edge $e \in G$ that does not belong to $C$. Thus, $e$ is **non-essential**. This contradicts the assumption that every edge in $G$ is **essential**.

**Proof:** Assume $\text{HAM-CYCLE} \in P$, meaning there exists a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that decides whether a given graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with a Hamiltonian cycle. We begin by setting $G^\ast = G$.

For each edge $e \in E$, we perform the following steps:

1. Remove $e$ from $G^\ast$, resulting in a subgraph $G'$.
2. Use algorithm $A$ to check if $G'$ still contains a Hamiltonian cycle:
    - **Case 1: $e$ is essential.** If removing $e$ from $G^\ast$ causes $G'$ to lose its Hamiltonian cycle, then $e$ must be part of every Hamiltonian cycle in $G^\ast$. In this case, $G^\ast$ remains unchanged.
    - **Case 2: $e$ is non-essential.** If $G'$ still contains a Hamiltonian cycle, then there exist Hamiltonian cycles in $G^\ast$ that do not include $e$. In this case, we safely remove $e$ from $G^\ast$, so we update $G^\ast = G'$.

The iterations ensure that $G^\ast$ remains a subgraph of $G$ that still contains a Hamiltonian cycle. Every edge that remains in the final graph must be essential for the last $G^\ast$. Thus, by the lemma above, $G^\ast$ must be a Hamiltonian cycle. Since $G^\ast$ is a subgraph of $G$, it is also a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$.

Algorithm $A$ runs in polynomial time, and since there are at most $O(n^2)$ edges in $G$, the total number of calls to $A$ is at most $O(n^2)$. Thus, the running time of the iterations is polynomial.

Finally, listing the vertices of the Hamiltonian cycle in order can be done in polynomial time. This involves starting from an arbitrary vertex in $G^\ast$ and following the Hamiltonian cycle in $G^\ast$. Regardless of whether the graph is stored with an adjacency list or adjacency matrix, this will take polynomial time.

Thus, the problem of listing the vertices of a Hamiltonian cycle in order can be solved in polynomial time.
